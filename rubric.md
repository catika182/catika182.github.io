# FEWD Final Project

---


### Description


For the final project, you'll be designing and building a website of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of front-end web development and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a website that you can add to your portfolio.  You could create: a portfolio website; a marketing website for a startup or business; or a prototype for a simple web-app. Work with your instructor and EIR's to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

**PASS**

Great job on your final project and presentation!

I've witnessed tremendous growth in you as a developer over the past 10 weeks, and it shows in the code of your final project.

I especially like the relatively well-formatted code structure and indentation with your HTML and even your JS. You made excellent use of many of the HTML5 structural elements in your code, and though your indentation is not consistent throughout your code, it is very solid nonetheless.

There were a few areas where you may have forgot to include quotes around HTML attributes, etc., so I'd recommend keeping an eye on this as you move forward to clean this up across the board.

All in all, excellent job and I hope you keep pushing forward!
